# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

## Description

This project contains various exercises to practice Python programming and Shell scripting. The tasks include running Python scripts, manipulating strings, and working with linked lists in C. The goal is to become familiar with basic programming concepts and script execution.



## Tasks:
- Run Python File: Develop a Shell script to execute a Python file specified by the environment variable $PYFILE.

- Run Inline Python Code: Create a Shell script to run Python code provided in the environment variable $PYCODE.

- Print a String: Write a Python script to output the exact string "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle" followed by a newline.

- Print Integer: Modify a Python script to print an integer followed by "Battery street" on the same line.

- Print Float: Complete a Python script to print a floating-point number with exactly two decimal places, prefixed by "Float:".

- Print String Multiple Times: Implement a Python script to print a string three times, followed by its first nine characters.

- String Manipulation: Develop a Python script to display specific substrings of a given string: the first three letters, the last two letters, and the middle section.

- Concatenate Strings: Write a Python script to concatenate predefined strings to form "object-oriented programming with Python".

- Zen of Python: Create a concise Python script that prints "The Zen of Python" by Tim Peters.

- Check for Cyclic Linked List: Implement a C function to determine if a singly linked list contains a cycle, focusing on efficient execution and minimal memory usage.
