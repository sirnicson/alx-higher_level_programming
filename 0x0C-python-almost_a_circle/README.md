# 0x0C. Python - Almost a Circle

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive exercise in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and Python fundamentals. It prepares students for more complex projects like the **AirBnB clone** by reinforcing key concepts such as classes, methods, inheritance, file handling, and JSON serialization/deserialization. Additionally, the project introduces the basics of unit testing in Python using the `unittest` module.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I will:
- Understand how to implement unit testing in Python projects.
- Know how to serialize and deserialize Python objects (store and restore object states).
- Be able to write and read JSON files in Python.
- Effectively use `*args` and `**kwargs` in function definitions.
- Be comfortable handling named arguments in Python functions.

## Project Structure

The project will be divided into several parts:
1. **Python Classes** – Create a series of classes to simulate real-world objects.
2. **Unit Tests** – Develop a suite of unit tests using the `unittest` module to validate the functionality of the Python classes.
3. **JSON Serialization** – Implement functionality to save and load objects from JSON format.
4. **File Handling** – Learn how to read from and write to files using Python's file I/O operations.

## Requirements

- All Python code will run on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** with Python 3.8.5.
- Follow the **pycodestyle** style guide.
- Ensure all files are executable and properly documented.
- A `README.md` file is mandatory at the root of the project folder.

## Testing

Tests will be written using the `unittest` module and will be located in a dedicated `tests` directory. Each class and function will be thoroughly tested to ensure correctness and edge cases will be handled.

## Installation

To run the scripts, clone the repository and make sure you have Python 3.8.5 installed.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/python-almost-a-circle.git
cd python-almost-a-circle
```
